# CardTap

### Simple way to share Information

This project focuses on making an app that allows users to share info in the form of s bussiness/personaized card at the tap of a phone. By bringing two devices together that are NFC-compatabile, the devices and the users can share info without the hassle of asking or recieiving a business card. This elminates all the clunk that comes with introdcutions, and leads the way for a quick, effcient, and paperless way of sharing contact information.
